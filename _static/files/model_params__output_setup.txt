`output_node`
  :Description: These are the 'sink' nodes representing the load or
                the aggregate consumer of the product(s) of the system.

                These are not real components, but a modelling construct.
                These nodes are not considered in the fragility
                calculations.

  :Data Type:   String. Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table,
                and must be of `node_type` sink.

  :Example:     'output_1'


`production_node`
  :Description: These are the real terminal nodes within the infrastructure
                system model. The completed 'product' of a system exits
                from this node.

  :Data Type:   String. Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table,
                and must be of `node_type` transshipment.

  :Example:     'gen_1'


`output_node_capacity`
  :Description: Production capacity that the specific production node
                is responsible for.

                The unit depends on the type of product the system
                produces (e.g. MW for generator plant).

  :Data Type:   Float

  :Example:     300


`capacity_fraction`
  :Description: The fraction of total production capacity of the
                output nodes. The sum of capacities of all nodes must
                equal 1.0.

  :Data Type:   Float :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 < x \leq 1\}}`

  :Example:     0.5


`priority`
  :Description: This parameter is used to assign relative sequential
                priority for output/production nodes in for the
                purposes of post-disaster recovery

  :Data Type:   Integer.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 1 \leq x \leq n\}}`,
                where `n` is the total number of output nodes

  :Example:     _
