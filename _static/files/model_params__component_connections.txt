`origin`
  :Description: The node (component) to which the tail of a directional
                edge is connected.

                For bidirectional connections, two edges must be defined
                within opposing directionality,
                e.g. A |rightarrow| B, and B |rightarrow| A.
                For undirected graphs the origin/destination designation
                is immaterial.

  :Data Type:   String.
                Must be one of the entries in the list of components
                defined under `component_id` in the module `component_list`.

  :Example:     'stack_1'


`destination`
  :Description: The node (component) on which the head of a directional
                edge terminates.
                For undirected graphs the origin/destination designation
                is immaterial.

  :Data Type:   String.
                Must be one of the entries in the list of components
                defined under `component_id` in the module `component_list`.

  :Example:     'turbine_condenser_1'


`link_capacity`
  :Description: Capacity of the edge.
                Its value can be more than the required flow of 1.0,
                which would represent excess capacity on the line.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R}\ \mid \ 0 \leq x \leq 1\}}`

  :Example:     1.0 (default value)


`weight`
  :Description: This parameter can be used to prioritise an edge or
                a series of edges (a path) over another edge or set
                of edges. This is intended to set preference for
                a particular path where path redundancies exist.

  :Data Type:   Integer

  :Example:     1 (default value)
