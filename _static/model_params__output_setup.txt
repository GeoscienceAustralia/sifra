`output_node`
  :Description: These are the 'sink' nodes representing the load or
                the aggregate consumer of the product(s) of the system.

                These are not real components, but a modelling construct.
                These nodes are not considered in the fragility
                calculations.

  :Data Type:   String.
                Must be one of the entries in the list of components
                defined under `component_id` in the module `component_list`,
                and must be of `node_type` sink.

  :Example:     'output_1'


`production_node`
  :Description: These are the real terminal nodes within the infrastructure
                system model. The completed product or output of a system
                exits the system boundary through this node.

  :Data Type:   String.
                Must be one of the entries in the list of components
                defined under `component_id` in the module `component_list`,
                and must be of `node_type` transshipment.

  :Example:     'gen_1'


`output_node_capacity`
  :Description: The part of total production capacity of the system that
                a specific production node is responsible for.

                The unit depends on the type of product the system
                produces (e.g. MW for generator plant). The unit is defined
                as part of the system metadata.

  :Data Type:   Float

  :Example:     300


`capacity_fraction`
  :Description: The fraction of total production capacity of the
                output nodes. The sum of capacities of all nodes must
                equal 1.0.

  :Data Type:   Float :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 < x \leq 1\}}`

  :Example:     0.5


`priority`
  :Description: This parameter is used to assign relative sequential
                priority for output nodes for the purposes of post-disaster
                recovery prioritisation.

  :Data Type:   Integer.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 1 \leq x \leq n\}}`,
                where `n` is the total number of output nodes

  :Example:     NA
