`origin`
  :Description: The node (component) to which the tail of a
                directional edge is connected.

                For bidirectional connections, you will need to define
                two edges, e.g. A |rightarrow| B, and B |rightarrow| A.
                For undirected graphs the origin/destination designation
                is immaterial.

  :Data Type:   String. Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table.

  :Example:     'stack_1'


`destination`
  :Description: The node (component) on which the head of a
                directional edge terminates. For undirected graphs
                the origin/destination designation is immaterial.

  :Data Type:   String. Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table.

  :Example:     'turbine_condenser_1'


`link_capacity`
  :Description: Capacity of the edge.
                It can be more than the required flow.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R}\ \mid \ 0 \leq x \leq 1\}}`

  :Example:     1.0 (default value)


`weight`
  :Description: This parameter can be used to prioritise an edge or
                a series of edges (a path) over another edge or set
                of edges.

  :Data Type:   Integer

  :Example:     1 (default value)
