.. _dmg_algo_component_type:

`component_type`
  :Description: The type of component, based on the typology definitions
                being used in the system model.

                Example: 'Demineralisation Plant'

  :Data Type:   Alphanumeric characters.
                May use dashes '-' or underscores '_'.
                Avoid using special characters.


.. _dmg_algo_damage_state:

`damage_state`
  :Description: The list of damage states used in defining the
                damage scale being modelled within the system.

                Example: For a four-state sequential damage scale,
                the following damage states are used:

                1. DS1 Slight
                2. DS2 Moderate
                3. DS3 Extensive
                4. DS4 Complete

  :Data Type:   String. Fixed, pre-determined state names.


`damage_function`
  :Description: The probability distribution for the damage function.

                Currently only log-normal curves are used, but additional
                distributions can be added as required.

                Example: 'lognormal'

  :Data Type:   String.


`mode`
  :Description: Number indicating the mode of the function.
                Currently can handle only unimodal or bimodal functions.

                Default value is 1.

  :Data Type:   Integer [1,2]


`damage_median`
  :Description: Median of the damage function.
                A median will need to be defined for each damage state.
                It should be typically be progressively higher for more
                severe damage states:

                :math:`{\mu_{DS1} \leq \mu_{DS2} \leq \mu_{DS3} \leq \mu_{DS4}}`

  :Data Type:   Float.


`damage_logstd`
  :Description: Standard deviation of the damage function.
                It will need to be defined for each damage state.
                The value of standard deviation should be such that
                the curves do not overlap.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`damage_ratio`
  :Description: The fractional loss of a component's value for damage
                sustained at a given damage state. This parameter links
                a damage state to expected direct loss of component value.

                Example:
                Damage ratio of 0.30 for damage state "DS2 Moderate"

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \leq x\}}`.
                A value of 0 indicates no loss of value, and
                a value of 1.0 indicates complete loss.
                In special cases the the value of loss ratio can be
                greater than 1.0, which indicates complete loss of
                component and additional cost of removal, disposal, or
                securing or destroyed component.


`functionality`
  :Description: An unitless fractional value indicating the functional
                capacity of a component for a given damage state.
                This parameter links damage states to expected
                post-impact residual functionality of the component.

                Example:
                A stack of a thermal power station is expected to remain
                fully functional (functionality==1), under 'Slight'
                damage state, i.e. under conditions of minor damage to
                structure with deformation of holding down bolts and with
                some bracing connections.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \leq x \leq 1.0\}}`.
                A value of 0 indicates no loss of value, and
                a value of 1.0 indicates complete loss.
                In special cases the the value of loss ratio can be
                greater than 1.0, which indicates complete loss of
                component and additional cost of removal, disposal, or
                securing or destroyed component.


`minimum`
  :Description: Minimum value for which the damage algorithm is
                applicable.

                Example:
                The algorithms presented by Anagnos :cite:`Anagnos1999`
                for 500kV circuit breakers are only applicable for
                PGA values of 0.15g and above, for the various noted
                failure modes.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`sigma_1`
  :Description: The first standard deviation for a bimodal
                damage function.

  :Data Type:   Float, for a bimodal function. For
                single mode functions, use 'NA'.


`sigma_2`
  :Description: The second standard deviation for a bimodal
                damage function.

  :Data Type:   Float, for a bimodal function. For
                single mode functions, use 'NA'.


`recovery_mean`
  :Description: The mean of the recovery function. Component and
                system restoration time are assumed to follow the
                normal distribution.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`recovery_std`
  :Description: The standard deviation of the recovery function.
                Component and system restoration time are assumed
                to follow the normal distribution.

  :Data Type:   Float.


`recovery_95percentile`
  :Description: [Optional paramter]
                Some times it is difficult to get the concept of
                standard deviation across to an audience of
                infrastructure experts, and hence it is difficult
                to get a reliable value for it. In such cases we can
                obtain a 95th percentile value for recovery time, and
                translate that to standard deviation for a normal
                distribution using the following equation:

                .. math::

                    \begin{align}
                    &X_{0.95} = \mu + Z_{0.95} \sigma \\
                    \Rightarrow &X_{0.95} = \mu + \Phi^{-1}(0.95) \sigma \\
                    \Rightarrow &\sigma = \frac{X_{0.95} - \mu}{\Phi^{-1}(0.95)}
                    \end{align}

  :Data Type:   Float


`fragility_source`
  :Description: Which source the fragility algorithm was adopted from,
                how it was adapted, or how it was developed.
