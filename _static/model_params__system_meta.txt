.. _system_meta:

This module of the model defines core metadata relevant to the
simulation of a given infrastructure model.
There is a free text 'notes' field for each of the parameters.
Users are encouraged to provide detailed information that may
be relevant to the model configuration and post-simulation validation
of results.

`INFRASTRUCTURE_LEVEL`
    :Description:   The scope of the infrastructure system.

    :Values:        Valid values are 'facility' or 'network'


`SYSTEM_CLASS`
    :Description:   The name of the asset class. It must have a
                    corresponding class definition in the module
                    `sira.modelling.infrastructure`.

    :Values:        The current set of valid system classes are as
                    outlined in this list: 

                    ['PowerStation',
                    'Substation',
                    'PotableWaterTreatmentPlant',
                    'PWTP',
                    'WasteWaterTreatmentPlant',
                    'WWTP',
                    'PotableWaterPumpStation']


`SYSTEM_SUBCLASS`
    :Description:   The subclass of the parent infrastructure system
                    as specified in `SYSTEM_CLASS`. For example, for the
                    SYSTEM_CLASS 'Substation', the logical system_subclass
                    options can be 'transmission', 'distribution',
                    'collector', etc.

    :Values:        Presently this is not implemented in code, but used
                    for informational purposes and for compatibility with
                    planned future functionality expansion.


`SYSTEM_COMPONENT_LOCATION_CONF`
    :Description:   Specifies whether the location information for system
                    components are specified in
                    :ref:`component list definition <model_params__component_list>`.
                    
                    A value of 'undefined' indicates that the location 
                    information for the components is not relevant to its
                    vulnerability analysis, AND the graph-drawing methods
                    are not constrained in placement of the components in
                    the system topology diagram.

                    A value of 'defined' indicates that the location
                    information of the components *may* be relevant to
                    the vulnerability analysis process, AND the graph-drawing
                    methods should respect the provided positional data in
                    placement of the components in the system topology
                    diagram.

    :Values:        Valid values must match: ['defined', 'undefined'].
                    If INFRASTRUCTURE_LEVEL=='network', then the value must
                    be defined.


`RESTORATION_TIME_UNIT`
    :Description:   The unit of time used for defining the component
                    restoration algorithms.
    
    :Values:        ['days', 'weeks', 'months', 'years']
