`input_node`
  :Description: The `component_id` of the input node.

  :Data Type:   String. Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table,
                and its `node_type` must be `supply`.

  :Example:     'coal_supply'


`input_capacity`
  :Description: The operational capacity of the node. It can be a real value
                value if known, or default to 100%.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \lt x \leq 100.0\}}`

  :Example:     100.0 (default value)


`capacity_fraction`
  :Description: What decimal fractional value of the input commodity
                enters the system through this input node.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \lt x \leq 1.0\}}`

  :Example:     1.0


`commodity_type`
  :Description: The type of commodity entering into the system through
                the specified input node.

  :Data Type:   String.

  :Example:     For a coal-fired power station there might be two
                commodities, namely coal and water. So, there will need
                to be at least two input nodes, one with a `commodity_type`
                of 'coal' and the other with `commodity_type` of 'water'.

                For an electric substation the `commodity_type` is
                electricity.
                For a water treatment plant, it is waster water.
