`input_node`
  :Description: The `component_id` of the input node.

  :Data Type:   String. 
                Must be one of the entries in the
                `component_id` columns in the `component_list` table,
                and its `node_type` must be `supply`.

  :Example:     'coal_supply'


`input_capacity`
  :Description: The operational capacity of the node. It can be a real
                value if known, or be given as a fraction of total
                normalised value of 100%.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \lt x \leq 100.0\}}`

  :Example:     100.0 (default value)


`capacity_fraction`
  :Description: The normalised value of the total required input commodity
                entering the system the given input node. The total quantity
                of required material is normalised to 1.0.

  :Data Type:   Float.
                :math:`{\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0.0 \lt x \leq 1.0\}}`

  :Example:     1.0


`commodity_type`
  :Description: The type of commodity entering into the system through
                the specified input node.

  :Data Type:   String.

  :Example:     A thermal power station will have two primary input
                commodities: fuel (for example coal) and water. So, for
                a coal-fired power station, there will need to be two
                input nodes defined (at a minumum), with the two types
                of `commodity_type` being 'coal' and 'water'.

                For an electric substation the `commodity_type` is
                electricity. For a water treatment plant, it will be 
                untreated water.
