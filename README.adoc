## Overview

SIFRA is a **System for Infrastructure Facility Resilience Analysis**.

It comprises a method and software tools that provide a framework
for simulating the fragility of infrastructure facilities to natural
hazards, based on assessment of the fragilities and configuration of
components that comprise the facility. Currently the system is designed
to work with earthquake hazards only. However, in the development of the
methodology and classes, there is a strong emphasis on making the
hazard attribution process and infrastructure models flexible to allow
for expansion to other hazards and new infrastructure sectors.

SIFRA was developed in http://www.ga.gov.au/[Geoscience Australia (GA)]
in support of the agency's vision to contribute to enhancing the resilience
of communities in Australia and its region.

Some key features of this tool:

- Open Source: Written in Python, and there is no dependency on proprietary
  tools. It should run on OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms.

- Flexible Infrastructure Model: The data model is based on graph theory.
  All infrastructure systems are represented as networks.
  This allows an user to develop arbitrarily complex custom facility models -
  for a Facility or a network â€“ for impact simulation.

- Extensible Component Library: User can define new instances of
  `component_type` (the building blocks of a facility) and link it to
  existing or custom fragility algorithms.

- Component Criticality: Scenario Analysis tools allow users to identify
  the cost of restoration for chosen scenarios, expected restoration times,
  and which component upgrades can most benefit the system.

- Restoration Prognosis: Users can experiment with different levels of
  hazards and post-disaster resource allocation to gauge restoration
  times for facility operations.


## Setup Instructions

It is good practice to set up a virtual environment for working with
developing code. This gives us the tools to manage the package
dependencies and requirements in a transparent manner, and impact of
dependency changes on software behaviour.

The virtual environments were initally described and implemented using
https://www.continuum.io/[Ananconda]. The new system is being designed as
microservices implemented in docker containers. If you have docker installed on
your system it is probably easiest to use the containers as described below.

### Building the Run Environment Using Docker

The AWS and Docker configuration is now the preferred way to deploy and develop
 the application.

#### Building an AMI for Dev Machines

To be able to have a easily replicable and deployable 
environment to run and test the code, we use AWS for 
provisioning dev machines. A basic dev instance can be setup 
using https://www.packer.io/intro/[Packer], by running the
following instructions in the current directory:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY = <AWS ACCESS KEY>
export AWS_SECRET_KEY = <AWS SECRET KEY>
packer build "installation\build.json"
```

To get the aws credentials follow this link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[guide].

#### Docker
The packer command that creates the AWS instance will run a 
shell script that will install Docker and clone the git repository
from Github. The details of the script are in `build-sifra-box.sh`

Creating the environment is done using the following commands:
```
cd sifra
docker build -t sifra -f 'installation/Dockerfile' .
```

Find the container Id using:

```
docker ps -a
```

To run an interactive container you can use:

```
docker start -i <CONTAINER ID>
```
or, simply run:

```
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/sifra" --name sifra sifra
```

This will give you a terminal inside the container in which you can execute
commands. Inside the container you can find the current directory mapped at
`/sifra`. You can modify files either within the container or the host and the
changes will be available in both.

For details of the commands see 
https://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/sifra/ch03_installation.html[Using docker]
in the help documentation


### Building the Run Environment Using Anaconda

For simplicity of managing virtual environments and
package requirements, https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/[Anaconda]
is a good option.
It is a free Python distribution, and comes with the ``conda`` tool
which is both a package manager and environment manager. Instructions
for installing ``Anaconda`` are here:
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>

**Prerequisites:** You will need to install ``Graphviz`` for the
drawing the system diagram through networkx and pygraphviz.
Please visit: <http://www.graphviz.org/>
and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
Please follow the posted download instructions carefully.
After installation you may need to update the PATH variable
with the location of the Graphviz binaries.

For windows systems you will need to install
Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7:
<http://aka.ms/vcpython27>

On Ubuntu you can

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential pkg-config \
    graphviz libgraphviz-dev \
    xml2 libxml2-dev
```

Some packages we need are not hosted in the main ``conda`` package
repository. In such cases we will host them in our own user channel.
We suggest adding the following channels to the default::

    $ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda
    $ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/marufr

Run the following command to confirm the additional channels have
been added:

    $ conda config --get channels

**For OS X and Linux-64 systems:** It should be possible to set up a
full run environment solely through the \*.yml environment specification
file. For OS X run the following commands:

    $ conda env create -f environment_osx.yml
    $ source activate sifra_env

For Linux-64 systems, the commands are identical, you will just need
to use the environment specification file for Linux.

**For Windows systems**, a similar process needs to be followed, with
some exceptions. First run:

    $ conda env create -f environment_win64.yml
    $ activate sifra_env

This will install most requirements except for ``igraph`` and
``pygraphviz``. Compiling these packages under windows can be very
challenging. The simplest and most reliable options is to download
the the appropriate wheels from Christoph Gohlke's unofficial page
of Windows binaries:
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>

For Windows 64 bit systems, you will need to download the ``wheels`` for
link:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-igraph[python-igraph]
and link:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygraphviz[pygraphviz]:

- ``python_igraph-0.7.1.post6-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl``
- ``pygraphviz-1.3.1-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl``

Install these downloaded ``wheels`` with pip:

    $ pip install <pkg_name>.whl


### Setting up a development Environment
Recent development has been done mostly on an AWS instance in PyCharm. This
requires tunnelling X11 through an SSH connection, which mostly works reasonably
well. 

The driver behind this is the authenticating proxy, which seems to break
docker in our use-case. Others have been able to run docker containers within
the GA network, but it was not considered a good use of development effort 
to attempt this with SIFRA.

PyCharm supports docker as detailed in the following links:

- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/docker.html[Pycharm Docker support]
- (https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/03/docker-compose-getting-flask-up-and-running/[Docker-Compose: Getting Flask up and running]

The following direcotories must be marked as 'Sources Root' in PyCharm. 

- sifra
- sifra-api

## Running the Code

Clone the repository onto your system. Detailed instructions can
be found https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/[here]

    $ git clone https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/sifra.git sifra

The code needs a setup file for configuring the model and simulation scenario.
It can be in any of three formats: `ini`, `conf`, or `json`. The code first
converts any setup file to json first before running.

**To run the code:** move into the root directory of `sifra` code, and use the
following commmand format, supplying with the requisite configuration file.

    $ python sifra -s simulation_setup/scenario_ss_x.ini

Sample configuration files are located in sifra\simulation_setup

Depending on the scale of the model, and simulation parameters chosen,
it may take between a few minutes and a few days to complete a run.

### Run Analysis on Previously Run Simulation Data

To run the post-simulation analysis on the generated output data, we need to
supply the setup file used to run the original simulation and the log file that
stores the directory locations for the the stored output data. For example:

    $ python sifra/scenario_loss_analysis.py \
        -s simulation_setup/scenario_ss_x.ini \
        -d logs/sifralog_20180619_155612_dirs.json

### Testing

To run tests use unittest. Move into sifra folder:

    $ cd sifra
    $ python -m unittest discover tests

If you are using docker as described above, you can do this within the sifra
container.


## Todo

- Restructure of Python code. While the simulation has been integrated with
  the json serialisation/deserialisation logic, the redundant classes should
  be removed and the capacity to create, edit and delete a scenario needs to 
  be developed.

- The handling of types within the web API is inconsistent; in some cases it
  works with instances, in others dicts and in others, JSON docs. This
  inconsistency goes beyond just the web API and makes everything harder to get.
  One of the main reasons for this is the late addtion of 'attributes'. These
  are meant to provide metadata about instances and I did not have a clear
  feel for whether they should be part of the instance or just associated with
  it. I went for the latter, which I think is the right choice, but did not
  have the time to make the API consistent throughout.

- Much work needs to be done on the GUI. It is currently very elementary. The
  Angular2 code contained herein is my first experience with it and being a
  prototype with a small time budget, I did not:
  - spend much time being idiomatically consistent,
  - leveraging existing elements of Angular2 (like
    link:https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/reactive-forms.html[reactive forms]),
  - ... writing tests.

- Consider whether a framework like http://redux.js.org/[Redux] would be useful.

- Perhaps get rid of ng\_select. I started with this before realising how easy
  simple HTML selects would be to work with and before reading about reactive
  forms (I'm not sure how/if one could use ng\_select with them). One benefit of
  ng\_select may be handling large lists and one may want to do some testing
  before removing it.

- Move the logic of merging an instance with its metadata (currently handled in
  sifra.structural.\_merge\_data\_and\_metadata) to the javascript. The document
  produced by that method is heavy due to its repetativeness and would hence be
  slow to pass around over the net. The logic is straight forward and would be
  easy to implment in javascript given the 'metadata' and instance.
