**************************
Simulation and Model Setup
**************************

The simulation setup requires two different sets of inputs. 
These two sets of input data are contained in two separate files:

- The config file: this file sets up the simulation scenario parameters
- The model file: this defines the components, their connections, along 
  with the fragility, loss, and recovery parameters for the infrastructure
  model.

These files, their parameters, data layout, and sample input data are
presented in the remainder of this Section. 

*Naming Requirement of Input File*:
The model file name must begin or end with the term 'model'. 
Similarly, the config file must have the term 'config' at the beginning
or end of its name. 

*Location Requirement for Input Files*:
The input files must reside within a directory named `input`. The parent
directory is named after the infrastructure asset by convention, but it can
have any name allowed by the local file system. This dir can be located in
any storage location where the user has access. The code is informed of
the location with a flag `-d` at execution time.

The outputs generated from the simulation are stored in a directory called
`output` within the same parent directory.

Let us assume a hypothetical project "PROJECT HAN", with the project 
folder located in the root directory. We also assume that within the 
project, we are modelling two systems named DANEEL and GISKARD. Then
the the input-output setup for the project will have the following
structure::

    .
    └── <PROJECT_HAN>
        ├── <SYSTEM-DANEEL>
        │   ├── input
        │   │   ├── config_system_T.json
        │   │   └── model_system_T.json
        │   └── output
        │      ├── ...
        │      ├── ...
        │      └── ...
        |
        └── <SYSTEM-GISKARD>
            ├── input
            │   ├── config_system_S.json
            │   └── model_system_S.json
            │
            └── output
               ├── ...
               ├── ...
               └── ...


.. _simulation-setup-file:

Simulation Setup File
=====================

The code needs a setup file for configuring the model and simulation scenario.
The code expects it in JSON format. 

The following table lists the parameters in the config file,
their description, and representative values.

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__simulation_setup.txt


.. _model-definition-file:

Infrastructure Model Definition File
====================================

The system model is defined using an MS Excel spreadsheet file.
It contains five worksheets. The names of the worksheets are fixed.
The function and format of these worksheets are described in the
following subsections:


.. _inputdata__component_list:

List of Components: component_list
----------------------------------

The *component_list* has the following parameters:

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__component_list.txt


.. _inputdata__component_connections:

Connections between Components: component_connections
-----------------------------------------------------

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__component_connections.txt


.. _inputdata__supply_setup:

Configuration of Supply Nodes: supply_setup
-------------------------------------------

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__supply_setup.txt


.. _inputdata__output_setup:

Configuration of Output Nodes: output_setup
-------------------------------------------

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__output_setup.txt


.. _inputdata__comp_type_dmg_algo:

Component Type Damage Algorithms: comp_type_dmg_algo
----------------------------------------------------

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__comp_type_dmg_algo.txt


.. _inputdata__damage_state_def:

Definition of Damage States: damage_state_def
---------------------------------------------

This table documents the physical damage characteristics that are implied
by the damage states used to model the fragility of the system components.

.. include::
   ./_static/files/model_params__damage_state_def.txt
