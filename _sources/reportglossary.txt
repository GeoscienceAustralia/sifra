    Acceleration
        Rate of change of velocity with time.

        
    Acceleration Response Spectrum
        A graphical plot of the maximum acceleration that structures having 
        different characteristics will experience when subjected to a specific 
        earthquake ground motion.

        
    Addition 
        An increase in the aggregate floor area, height, or number of stories 
        of a structure.

        
    Alteration
        Any construction or renovation to an existing structure other than an addition.

        
    Appendage 
        An architectural component such as a canopy, marquee, ornamental balcony, 
        or statuary.

        
    Amplification 
        A relative increase in the magnitude of a quantity, such as ground motion 
        or building shaking. 

        
    Amplitude 
        The maximum value of a time-varying quantity.

        
    Architectural Components 
        Components such as exterior cladding, ceilings, partitions, and finishes.

        
    Base 
        The level at which the horizontal seismic ground motions are considered to be 
        imparted to a structure.

        
    Base Shear Force 
        A term used in linear structural analysis techniques to describe the vector 
        sum of the lateral forces that are applied to the structure to represent 
        the effects of earthquake shaking.
