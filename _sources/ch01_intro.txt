Introduction
**************

Critical infrastructure facilities typically comprise a number of 
interconnected components that work in concert to deliver a service. 
In the context of natural hazard vulnerability, the components have differing 
susceptibilities, require different resource levels and time to repair, and 
have a range of criticalities to the overall service delivery. The 
vulnerability of the facility, then, is a complex convolution of all these 
components and factors.

SIFRA stands for *System for Infrastructure Facility Resilience Analysis*. 
It comprises a method and software tools that provide a framework for 
simulating the fragility of infrastructure facilities to natural hazards, 
based on assessment of the fragilities and configuration of components that 
comprises the facility. Currently the system is designed to work with 
earthquake hazards only. ``SIFRA`` enables the vulnerabilities of each element 
to be integrated into an assessment of the implications of severe hazard 
exposure to facility damage, service disruption and cost. 

SIFRA is used to model the vulnerability of high-value infrastructure 
facilities to natural hazards. Earthquake ground motion is the present focus 
and many uncertainties are captured through a Monte Carlo sampling process. 
The tool not only enables current facility vulnerability to be quantified, 
but also enables the most vulnerable components to be identified in terms of 
repair cost, time to recovery, and service disruption implications. The 
outcomes also support benefit versus cost studies of retrofit options. 
Ultimately, it provides information that supports asset managers in regards 
to the most cost-effective utilisation of limited retrofit resources.

.. _intro-features:

The following are some key features of this tool:

- Written in Python: It is written in Python, and there is no
  dependency on proprietary tools. It should run on OS X, Windows, and
  Linux platforms.
- Flexible Facility Model: ``facility`` data model is based on network
  theory, allowing the user to develop arbitrarily complex custom
  facility models for simulation.
- Extensible Component Library: User can define new ``component types``
  (the building blocks of a facility) and link it to existing or
  custom fragility algorithms.
- Component Criticality: Scenario Analysis tools allow users to
  identify the cost of restoration for chosen scenarios, expected
  restoration times, and which component upgrades can most benefit
  the system.
- Restoration Prognosis: User can experiment with different levels of
  hazards and post-disaster resource allocation to gauge restoration
  times for facility operations.

.. _intro-design-notes:

:term:`Vulnerability <vulnerability>` of a facility is modelled by assigning 
fragilities to the individual components that make up a facility. The program 
accounts for variability in component fragilities by sampling probability 
distributions for the each fragility curve median and beta values. Once values 
have been selected for each curve it checks that :term:`fragility curves` do 
not overlap and if they do, re-samples the median and beta probability 
distributions until non-overlapping fragility curves are produced.

Damage scales for several assets, and method for estimating recovery times 
have been taken from HAZUS |nbsp| :cite:p:`hazus-mh-mr5`.
Repair cost (and hence damage index) and recovery times for each component are 
customised for each asset type, based on consultation with assets operators.
The threshold values of spectral acceleration for each of four damage states 
are sampled by randomly sampling the fragility curves described above.

Hazard modelling is to be done externally, and provided to this tool as an 
input. Currently only peak ground acceleration can be accepted by the system.
