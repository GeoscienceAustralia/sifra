Release: |release|

SIFRA stands for **System for Infrastructure Facility Resilience Analysis**.
It is a tool for analysing  impact of hazards (environmental excitation)
on lifeline infrastructure.

It provides a method and software tools to systematise simulation of
fragility of infrastructure to natural hazards, based on assessment
of the fragilities and configuration of components that comprise the
infrastructure system. The current focus has been on studying responses
of infrastructure facilities (e.g. power generation plants, high voltage
substations). Considerable work has been done in the code backend to
extend the same methodology to model networks as well (e.g. electricity
transmission networks).

Currently the software has been tested to work with earthquake hazards only.
However, the methodology and class structure have been developed such
that the platform is effectively hazard agnostic. The hazard attribution
process and infrastructure models are flexible to allow for expansion
to other hazards and new infrastructure sectors.

SIFRA was developed in `Geoscience Australia (GA) <http://www.ga.gov.au/>`_
in support of the agency's vision to contribute to enhancing the resilience
of communities in Australia and its region.


Features
========

**Open Source:**
    Written in Python, and there is no dependency on
    proprietary tools. It should run on OS X, Windows, and
    Linux platforms.

**Flexible Infrastructure Model:**
    The data model is based on graph theory. All infrastructure systems
    are represented as networks. This allows an user to develop
    arbitrarily complex custom facility models -- for a :term:`Facility`
    or a network -- for impact simulation.

**Extensible Component Library:**
    User can define new instances of `component_type`
    (the building blocks of a facility) and link it to existing or
    custom fragility algorithms.

**Component Criticality Analysis:**
    Scenario Analysis tools allow users to identify the cost of
    restoration for chosen scenarios, expected restoration times,
    and which component upgrades can most benefit the system.

**Restoration Prognosis:**
    User can experiment with different levels of hazards and
    post-disaster resource allocation to gauge restoration
    times for facility operations.
