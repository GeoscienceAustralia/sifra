<h2>2.1. Facility System Model<a class="headerlink" href="#facility-system-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Facilities are modelled in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sifra</span></code> methodology as a network of components.
This approach affords three key advantages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>it allows for modelling the effect of impaired or destroyed components
on the operational capacity of the system,</li>
<li>it allows for using graph theory to assess the graduated capacity
degradation, and restoration, through modelling flow through the
network, and</li>
<li>it allows for detection of the most efficient &#8216;paths&#8217;, or sets of
components, through the network that need to be restored in order to
establish a link between input and output nodes, i.e. to restore the
flow through the network which represents the productive capacity of
the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The concept of components and facilities used in this exercise map closely
to the typology of micro- and macro-components respectively, as defined in
the Synerg-G program (Pitilakis et al. 2014), and align with the definition
of subsystems and systems as defined in (Rinaldi et al. 2001). Under this
scheme, the components are represented as nodes. Based on their role within
the system, these nodes, or components, are classified in four categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>Supply nodes</em>: These nodes represent thr entry points into the system
for required inputs or commodities. As for example, coal and water can be
the required ‘commodities’ into a thermal power station. In the case of
the substation, required input is electricity from power stations or other
substations.</li>
<li><em>Output nodes</em>: These nodes represent the exit points for the output of
the system. For example, in the case of the power station, the output nodes
act as dummy loads - representing the energy consumers - connected to each
of the step-up transformers. The sum of flow through the network measured
at the output nodes represented the effective production (or operational)
capacity of the facility.</li>
<li><em>Dependency nodes</em>: These nodes represent the components that do not
directly participate in the production process of the system, or in the
handling of system inputs, but are critical for system operations in some
other capacity, e.g. system management or monitoring. The control building
of a substation is an example of this.</li>
<li><em>Transhipment nodes</em>: These are nodes that transform, transport, or store
system inputs to give effect to processes that produces the outputs
required of the system. Majority of the nodes within a system fall into
this category.</li>
</ol>
<p>The component configuration and redundancies are captured as edges connecting
the nodes. Constraints on flow through specific paths, or sets of nodes, can
be represented as capacities of edges connecting those nodes. Figure 2.1
illustrates this concept for a thermal power station.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="pwrstn-schematic-diagram">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/pwrstn_schematic_diagram.png"><img alt="Power station schematic" src="_images/pwrstn_schematic_diagram.png" style="width: 98%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The &#8216;edges&#8217;, or inter-nodal connections, represent a link or a process for
maintaining &#8216;flow&#8217; of goods or services within the system, and thus their
directionality is important. For the power station, the edges are
unidirectional, since the inputs flow in one direction starting from the
entry point into the system and are progressively transformed through the
system to generate energy – the end product. However, a substation is an
electrical network where electricity – the system &#8216;commodity&#8217; – can flow in
either direction through an edge (electrical conductor) as dictated by load
demands and system constraints. Therefore, most of the edges in the
substation are bidirectional, unless specifically constrained.</p>
<p>Connection paths and &#8216;production capacities&#8217; along those paths within a system
are calculated as the maximum flow through those paths.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://igraph.org/python/">igraph</a> Python package was used as the
network modelling platform to calculate graph metrics for a post-hazard
damaged system model.</p>

<div class="section" id="translating-hazard-impact-to-system-loss">
<h2>2.2. Translating hazard impact to system loss<a class="headerlink" href="#translating-hazard-impact-to-system-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a given value of level of ground shaking, a set of random samples is
generated, and the damage state of each component is calculated for each
random sample based on the fragility function of the given component. Given
the assessed damage state of all the system components, the system
functionality is assessed and system output level calculated. This process
is run through a Monte Carlo process for the set of random samples to assess
the system response at the selected ground shaking intensity. To obtain a
characterisation of the system and develop fragility algorithms for the
system (e.g. the power station) the process is repeated for a range of PGA
values. This Process is shown in Figure 2.2.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-hazard-loss-link">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/hazard_loss_link.png"><img alt="Linking hazard to damage and loss" src="_images/hazard_loss_link.png" style="width: 98%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Four discrete sequential damage states are used for assessing system
fragility, similar to those used in HAZUS (FEMA 2003): DS1 Slight,
DS2 Moderate, DS3 Extensive, DS4 Complete. The damage scale used for a power
station is based on ranges of economic loss as a percentage of total system
value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-restoraion-model">
<h2>2.3. System Restoraion Model<a class="headerlink" href="#system-restoraion-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The restoration algorithms are defined as normal functions. An approximation
of mean restoration time for each component at each damage level is
attributed. The structural damage level definitions associated with the
damage states are central to establishing a common understanding to
facilitate the development of the restoration parameters.</p>
<p>The functionality <span class="math">\(F_C\)</span> of component C at t time units after impact of an
earthquake of PGA=x is calculated as a weighted combination of the
probability of the components being in each of the S sequential damage
states used in the model and the estimated recovery at time t for the
components based of the restoration model:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqn-recovery-time">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[F_{C|x} = \sum_{i=0}^{S} P[{ds}_i | PGA=x] \times R_i[t]\]</div>
<p>where, mathit{i} is the index of the damage state,
<span class="math">\({i \in \mathbb{Z} | 0 \ge i \ge S}\)</span>.
The &#8216;None&#8217; damage state is <em>i=0</em>, and <em>i=S</em> is the complete or highest
modelled damage state. <span class="math">\(R_i[t]\)</span> is the likely level of restoration of
functionality at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. Restoration level <span class="math">\(R_i\)</span> can take on
any value in the unit interval [0,1].</p>
<p>The simulation of the restoration prognosis is conducted based on a set of
inputs and assumptions. The required data inputs to this process are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The system configuration</li>
<li>The modelled scenario - seismic intensity value</li>
<li>Impact simulation results - system component losses</li>
<li>Restoration priority list - the order at which output lines should
be recovered</li>
</ul>
<p>The process assumes that restoration is undertaken in stages, subject to
the level of resources that can be made available and the order of repairs.
In regard to this, the concept of &#8216;<em>Restoration Streams</em>&#8216; is used&#8211;the
maximum number of components that can be worked on simultaneously. This is
effectively a proxy representing the deployment of trained personnel and
material for the repair tasks. Additional optional offsets can be factored
in to capture specific contexts:
(i) <em>Restoration Offset</em> – this is a time allowance for assessment of
damage to the system and for securing the site to assure it is safe for commencement of repairs;
(ii) <em>Testing and Commission Interval</em>: this is a time allowance for testing
conformity with operational and safety parameters for the system, or a part
thereof.</p>
<p>Given a set of restoration parameters and the restoration plan, the consequent restoration time is calculated as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Test if there is any available path between the set of required input
nodes (i.e. supply nodes) and the output node assigned the highest
priority to meet the demand at that node.</li>
<li>If no functional path is found, then identify the least expensive path(s)
that needs to be restored to meet demand at the output node. Within each
path, identify the functional status of the nodes (components), and
generate a repair list.</li>
<li>Iterate through the ordered output list, repeating steps 1 and 2 above.
Update the component repair list and produce a complete prioritised list
of components to repair or replace.</li>
<li>Simulate an ordered restoration process based on the above list and
user-specified resource constraints. If the process is using x resource
constraints, then whenever a component is restored (and the number of
unrepaired components is ≥x), the next component is added to the active
repair list, so that at any one time x repair tasks are in progress. This
process is repeated until all the paths are restored, i.e. until system
output capacity is restored to normal levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to restore full capacity at an output node, it may be necessary to
restore more than one path, i.e. connect an output node to multiple input
nodes. This can be understood through some simple examples. If the facility
in question is a thermal power station, the functioning of the generator
depends on both the supply of fuel (as the source of energy to be
transformed) and water (for cooling and for steam production to drive the
turbines). In case of a substation, a certain output node may have a demand
of 300MW, but it might be that there are four incoming lines each bringing
in bringing in 100MW of electricity from power plants. In this case, the
designated output node must be linked to at least three of the input/supply
nodes to meet its demand.</p>
<p>In addition to the core process of approximating restoration time, a
routine for simulating component cannibalisation within a facility or system
has also been incorporated. Here we use cannibalisation to refer to an
exercise whereby an operator may move an undamaged component from a low
priority or redundant line to replace a damaged component on a high priority
line. This exercise may allow the operator to eliminate the potentially long
procurement or transportation time for a replacement unit, and thereby
expedite the restoration of the high priority lines.</p>
<p>The outputs from the restoration model are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>a simple Gantt chart with each component needing repair,</li>
<li>restoration plot for each output line over time and the associated
percentage of total system capacity rehabilitated, and</li>
<li>total restoration time for each output line for a given restoration
scheme.</li>
</ol>
